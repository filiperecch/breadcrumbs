breadcrumbs is a package to help you find your way home after a long day of getting lost exploring your data. Its primary goal is to provide structure to Rproject directories so that you can readily store code and data in appropriate folders, and coordinate that code and data with ease. 

The code for this package can be found at https://github.com/joepowers16/breadcrumbs

If you wish to complete the vignettes, please download the Google Drive folder https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tfx12J8mhEzpEGOil8UIKXP7Mb7V_F7N?usp=sharing and place it directly within the breadcrumbs/ directory.

Please note that this package is still in an early phase of development and has fairly low test coverage at this time (2019-05-22).
